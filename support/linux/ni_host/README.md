# dbm-nihost: NI Maschine Mk2 and JAM on Linux

On Windows and macOS, NI's driver turns the USB HID of a Maschine into MIDI ports. There is no
such driver on Linux. `dbm-nihost` does its job: it drives the **Maschine Mk2** and the
**Maschine JAM** over hidraw and creates ALSA sequencer ports with NI's names:

| Device | DAW input | DAW output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Maschine Mk2 | `Maschine MK2 In` | `Maschine MK2 Out` |
| Maschine JAM | `Maschine Jam - 1 Input` | `Maschine Jam - 1 Output` |

The MIDI follows the DrivenByMoss NI Controller Editor templates (`resources/Maschine Mk2`,
`resources/Maschine Jam`). DrivenByMoss (the Rust port, or the Java version) therefore works with
these ports as with NI's driver. Background and design: `doc/NI_HOST_LINUX_PLAN.md`.

## Build and run

Needs CMake, a C++17 compiler and the ALSA headers (`alsa-lib`).

```
cmake -S support/linux/ni_host -B build-nihost
cmake --build build-nihost
build-nihost/dbm-nihost            # both devices; --mk2 / --jam for one, --log-midi to log the MIDI
```

The devices can be plugged in and out while it runs. Access to `/dev/hidraw*` needs the udev rule
in `udev/70-ni-maschine.rules`.

## Tools and tests

- `nihost-probe` prints the decoded HID events of both devices and lights a test pattern.
- `nihost-test` (also `ctest`) tests the translation with synthetic HID reports and MIDI.
- `tools/gen_template_map.py <repository root> src/template_map.h` regenerates the template
  tables from the NI templates. `tests/ni_templates.rs` in the Rust crate checks them against the
  Maschine surfaces.

## What is emulated

- **Input:** buttons, pads (Mk2 with velocity), encoders (relative, two's complement), the JAM
  matrix, touch strips with touch, and the JAM's Shift (as NI's sysex).
- **Output:** button LEDs, pad, group and scene colours (NI's palette, hue × 4 + level), the JAM
  strip modes from the `STRIP_SETUP` sysex, and the Mk2 displays (Mackie MCU text, 2 × 56
  characters split across both displays).
- **Not yet:** the Mk2 pad pressure as poly aftertouch, the JAM level meters and footswitch.

## Origin

The HID protocol classes come from KICK's `kick_controllers` module (same author, relicensed to
LGPL-3.0). Their tables, the font and part of the palette come from
